The data model for Clumi is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing developers to easily understand and work with their cloud solutions.

The main components of the data model are:

### 1. Cloud Service: 
This represents the abstract cloud service that the user wants to emulate (e.g. cloud storage, compute, database). It includes properties such as name, type, and configuration.

### 2. Provider: 
This component represents the specific cloud provider the user wants to emulate (e.g. AWS, Azure). It includes properties such as name, region, and credentials.

### 3. Resource: 
This component represents the resources that are used by the cloud service. For example, in the case of cloud storage, it could include properties such as bucket name, file name, and data.

### 4. Deployment: 
This component represents the deployment of the simulated cloud service on a real cloud provider. It includes properties such as provider, region, and configuration.

The data model is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for new services and providers to be easily added in the future. The user can easily create, configure, and test their cloud solutions using the Clumi data model, and then use the deployment component to replicate it on a real cloud provider.

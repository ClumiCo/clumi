# Introducing Clumi - The Revolutionary Cloud Emulator for Developers

`The project is still in the early ideation, nothing currently is working !`

Developers, it's time to say goodbye to costly cloud subscription fees and hello to Clumi - the new cloud emulator that lets you test your cloud solutions locally using your own dev box resources. Clumi is compatible with most popular cloud providers like AWS and Azure and requires minimal dependencies, making it the perfect tool for developers of all skill levels.

With Clumi, you can easily test and debug your cloud solutions without incurring additional costs or using up valuable subscription resources. This not only saves you money but also allows you to work more efficiently by testing your solutions in a local environment. Once you've finished testing and verification, you can replicate your test environment on the real cloud with confidence that your solution is fully functional and ready for production.

## What's an emulator?

Clumi is a cloud emulator that allows developers to test their cloud solutions locally on their own machines without incurring additional costs or using up valuable subscription resources. It is designed to behave like popular cloud providers such as AWS and Azure, and is compatible with most cloud solutions. The main advantage of emulating the cloud, rather than simulating it, is that it allows developers to create realistic real-world test scenarios, replicating the functionality of a cloud provider in a local environment. This helps developers to test and debug their cloud solutions more efficiently and effectively, with the confidence that their solution is fully functional and ready for production once deployed on the real cloud. By providing a cost-effective and easy-to-use solution, Clumi is helping developers to save money, work more efficiently, and improve the quality of their cloud solutions.
